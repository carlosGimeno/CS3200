----------------------------------



Our product is envisioned as a system for driverâ€™s license application (both 1st time and renewals), for government use of any State (or even for government organizations outside of the US). With this, we hope to solve the issue of having to fill in paper-based applications for both procedures. Having this is also going to be convenient for the dmv, because the process of storing and retrieving data is going to be facilitated. Instead of having to manually store and input all this paper-based application into the system they use, it will be automatically uploaded.
